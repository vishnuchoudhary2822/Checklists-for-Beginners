- [ ] Authentication with Passport.js (JWT & sessions)  
- [ ] Guards & Role-based Authorization  
- [ ] File upload handling (Multer)  

---

## âœ… Advanced Topics (Week 11-12)
- [ ] Caching with Redis  
- [ ] Queues with Bull.js (background jobs)  
- [ ] WebSockets (real-time communication)  
- [ ] GraphQL with NestJS  
- [ ] Microservices in NestJS (TCP, gRPC, Kafka, RabbitMQ)  

---

## âœ… Real-World Application
- [ ] Build a REST API with authentication & role-based access  
- [ ] Implement Swagger/OpenAPI docs  
- [ ] Add unit & e2e tests (Jest + Supertest)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Pro Tips for Success
- Always start with **vanilla Node.js** to understand the core  
- NestJS is opinionated: stick to its conventions for scalability  
- Write **tests early**; donâ€™t wait till the end  
- Document APIs with **Swagger** for real-world use  
- Learn **asynchronous patterns** deeply (async/await, promises, streams)  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps
After mastering Node.js & NestJS, dive into:  
- Advanced microservices architecture  
- Event-driven design with Kafka/NATS  
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in NestJS  
- Full-stack with React/Next.js + NestJS backend  
- Building SaaS / enterprise-scale applications
