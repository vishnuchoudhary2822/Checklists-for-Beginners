---

## âœ… Essential Queries (Week 3-4)
- [ ] **SELECT** statements: Retrieve specific columns and all data (`SELECT *`, `SELECT column_name`)  
- [ ] **WHERE** clauses: Filter data with conditions (`=`, `>`, `<`, `LIKE`, `IN`)  
- [ ] **ORDER BY**: Sort results ascending and descending  
- [ ] **LIMIT/TOP**: Control how many rows you get back  
- [ ] Practice daily: Write **5 basic queries** every day for muscle memory  

---

## âœ… Data Manipulation (Week 5-6)
- [ ] String functions: `CONCAT`, `SUBSTRING`, `UPPER`, `LOWER` for text cleaning  
- [ ] Date functions: Extract year, month, day from timestamps  
- [ ] Math operations: `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` for calculations  
- [ ] NULL handling: `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, `COALESCE`  
- [ ] **DISTINCT**: Remove duplicate values from results  

---

## âœ… Intermediate Skills (Week 7-8)
- [ ] **GROUP BY**: Aggregate data by categories  
- [ ] **HAVING**: Filter grouped results (different from WHERE)  
- [ ] Basic JOINs: **INNER JOIN** to combine related tables  
- [ ] Subqueries: Write queries inside other queries  
- [ ] **CASE** statements: Create conditional logic in your queries  

---

## âœ… Advanced Techniques (Week 9-12)
- [ ] All JOIN types: **LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER** joins  
- [ ] Window functions: `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, running totals  
- [ ] **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Make complex queries readable  
- [ ] Data cleaning: Handle duplicates, missing values, format inconsistencies  
- [ ] Performance basics: Understand indexes and query optimization  

---

## âœ… Real-World Application
- [ ] Work with messy data: Practice on real datasets from **Kaggle** or government sources  
- [ ] Build a **portfolio project**: Analyze a dataset and document your findings  
- [ ] Learn visualization basics: Connect SQL to tools like **Tableau** or **Power BI**  
- [ ] Practice business scenarios: **Sales analysis, customer segmentation, trend identification**  

---

## âœ… Professional Development
- [ ] Join SQL communities: **Stack Overflow, Reddit r/SQL, LinkedIn groups**  
- [ ] Follow SQL experts: Learn from industry professionals and best practices  
- [ ] Take on challenges: **HackerRank, LeetCode SQL** problems  
- [ ] Document your learning: Share your progress and help other beginners

## ðŸŽ¯ Pro Tips for Success
- Practice consistently: **30 minutes daily beats 5 hours once a week**  
- Start simple: Master basics before jumping to complex queries  
- Use real data: Work with datasets relevant to your industry  
- Explain your queries: *If you canâ€™t explain it, you donâ€™t understand it*  
- Learn from errors: Every error message is a learning opportunity  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Next Steps
Once you've mastered these fundamentals, you'll be ready for:  
- Advanced analytics and statistical functions  
- Database design and normalization  
- ETL processes and data pipelines  
- Integration with **Python/R** for data science
